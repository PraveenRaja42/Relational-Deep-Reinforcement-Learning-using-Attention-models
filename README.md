# Relational-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Attention-models


Implementing a Relational Reinforcement Algorithm using the self-attention model with DQN to increase the Interpretability and performance of Machine Learning models. 

Visualizing attention maps to better interpret the reasoning of an RL agent playing "Breakout-v4"(gym env) 


 Einops, an extension of the capabilities of PyTorchâ€™s built-in Einsum function is used. 
 
 $ pip install einops
